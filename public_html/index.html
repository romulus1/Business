                    <p>Yeah, like I'm going to take a whiz through this $5,000 suit. COME ON. There's a girl in my soup! Each year, Oscar attempts the four hundred mile walk from Newport Beach to Berkeley, California. In the twelve years that he's attempted this, he's never made it farther than UC Irvine. I'm afraid I'm with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. Great, now I'm gonna smell to high heaven like a tuna melt! That was Tom Cruise, the actor. They said he was some kind of scientist. I'm tired of trying to find happiness through lies and self-medicating. If you need me, I'll be at the bar.</p>

                    <p>There's a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. Mission Accomplished. That was Tom Cruise, the actor. Lucille: They said he was some kind of scientist. Do the right thing here. String this blind girl along so that dad doesn't have to pay his debt to society. I hear the jury's still out on science. Oh, yeah, the $4,000 suit is holding the elevator for a guy who doesn't make that in 3 months. Come on! Heyyyy uncle father Oscar.</p>

                    <p>I'm gonna go get sexy. What about macaroni – let me finish – salad? I need a tea to give my dingle less tingle. I see you've wasted no time in filling my seat hole.</p>
